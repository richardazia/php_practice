## Starting a server via PHP
I didn't know that PHP had an in-built server and this is really useful to know about. With the inbuilt server you can navigate to the required directory, start the server and start coding. No need for XAMPP or any of the other solutions. If PHP is installed then it takes seconds to be up and running. 
$ cd ~/public_html
$ php -S localhost:8000

## Course code
Much of this code is from courses, but I usually change variables, arrays and more to make sure that I understand the ideas, if not how to write the code from scratch by myself yet. That will come with time. The code comes from Learning PHP by Joe Casabona on Linkedin Learning, so if you want to learn more look up his course.
